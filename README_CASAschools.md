2\. Relationship between files, if important:

All of the repositories up to shiny_dashboard contain the code needed to
create final outputs for use in the California Schools Climate Hazards
Dashboard. The shiny_dashboard uses these datasets, which are included
as a part of this submission.

**METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION**

1\. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:

Data for extreme heat and extreme precipitation were retrieved using API
requests from the caladaptr package. The data retrieved to calculate
extreme heat days were historical observed daily maximum temperature for
1961-2005 and projected daily maximum temperature for 2006-2064. The
data retrieved to calculate extreme precipitation days were historical
observed daily precipitation totals for 1961-2005 and projected daily
precipitation totals for 2006-2064.

Data for wildfire, flooding, and sea level rise were downloaded directly
from their sources and stored in a remote server for use.

2\. Methods for processing the data:

All data were processed in R Studio using Quarto Docs. Tabular data for
extreme heat and precipitation first used the retrieved historical data
to calculate a threshold value to classify an extreme event. The
threshold was determined to be the 98th percentile value of observed
historical data for California. For extreme heat, this is 98°F. For
extreme precipitation, this is 0.73 inches. Then, projected daily values
exceeding these thresholds were assigned a 1, and those not exceeding
assigned a 0. The count of projected extreme days within each year from
2005-2064 was then assigned to each California public school.

Spatial data was mainly processed to serve mapping purposes in the
dashboard. The wildfire raster was clipped to the boundaries of
California and reclassified. The mean wildfire hazard potential score
for each school area was also derived and attached to each school. The
original FEMA flood polygons have many different classifications, which
were reclassified into three categories: high risk, moderate to low
risk, and undetermined risk. The percentage of each school area that
falls within a high risk flood zone was also attached to each school.
The sea level rise polygons simply describe the extent of flooding under
a 0.8 feet sea level rise scenario and a 100-year coastal storm. The
polygons were simplified to decrease map load times in the dashboard.
The percentage of each school area affected by the sea level rise
scenario and a 100-year coastal storm were also attached to each school.
