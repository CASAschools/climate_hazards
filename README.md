# Climate Hazards

### Description
The CASAschools capstone team identified 5 climate hazards that are actionable, relevant to schools, and align with California's 4th climate change assessment. These include wildfire, extreme heat days, extreme precipitation, flooding, and sea level rise. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for each climate variable with detailed explanations on how the data was wrangled and prepared for Indexing and visualization in the interactive dashboard.
