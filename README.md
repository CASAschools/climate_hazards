# Climate Hazards

## Description
The CASAschools capstone team identified 5 climate hazards that are actionable, relevant to schools, and align with California's 4th climate change assessment. These include wildfire, extreme heat days, extreme precipitation, flooding, and sea level rise. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Rmd's for each climate variable with detailed explanations on how the data was wrangled and prepared for Indexing and visualization in the interactive dashboard.

## Data Sources
The 5 climate hazards were obtaind from the following open source databases:
- Extreme heat: [Cal-Adapt API](https://github.com/berkeley-gif/caladapt-docs)
- Flooding: [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://hazards-fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8b0adb51996444d4879338b5529aa9cd)
- Extreme precipitation: [Cal-Adapt API](https://github.com/berkeley-gif/caladapt-docs)
- Sea Level Rise: [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/sea-level-rise-map-viewer)
- Wildfire: [U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) Wildfire Hazard Potential](https://www.firelab.org/project/wildfire-hazard-potential)


## Usage

This repository contains folders with notebooks detailing how to acess the data from API's and open source databases. As well as, how the data was wrangled and tidied for calculating the aggregated risks.
