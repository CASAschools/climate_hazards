Mapping wildfire for school districts. The plan to map is to overlay school buffers areas on top of the wildfire raster data. We should use the buffers that are the complete buffers for mapping so that users can see information about the school's average wildfire hazard potential score.


```{r}
# read in ca wildfire data
whp_ca <- rast("/capstone/casaschools/wildfire/intermediate_layers/whp_ca.tif")

# read in reclassified whp data
whp_reclass <- rast("/capstone/casaschools/wildfire/intermediate_layers/whp_reclass.tif")

# read in school buffers clipped
schools_buffers_clip <- st_read("/capstone/casaschools/schools_data/schools_buffer_clip/schools_buffer_clip.shp",
                                quiet = TRUE)

# schools buffers
schools_buffers <- st_read("/capstone/casaschools/schools_data/schools_buffer/schools_points_buffer.shp",
                           quiet = TRUE)
```

Mapping will happen school by school.
- should the raster be reclassified as categorical? Yes.

```{r}
## mapping
tmap_mode("view")

# filter for one school
dp <- schools_buffers %>% 
  filter(SchoolName == "Dos Pueblos Senior High")

# create the school point as the centroid of the buffer
dp_point <- dp %>% 
  st_centroid()

# select the wildfire hazard potential cells that overlap
whp_school <- crop(whp_reclass, dp)

# define custom color palette and labels
palette = c("white", "#fee391", "#fec44f", "#fe9929", "#d95f0e", "#993404")
labels <- c("non-burnable", "very low", "low", "moderate", "high", "very high")

# map it
tm_shape(whp_school) +
  tm_raster(title = "Wildfire Hazard Potential",
            breaks = 0:6, 
            labels = labels,
            palette = palette,
            alpha = .5) +
  tm_shape(dp) +
  tm_borders(alpha = .3) +
  # map the school point
  tm_shape(dp_point) +
  tm_dots(size = .5, fill = "red", shape = 19)
```
